### My name is Jamie Amelia Troubetaris, welcome to my Github!

I'm a recent graduate of Umass Amherst with a B.S. in computer science. My interests are primarily in cybersecurity and digital forensics but I'm always excited to learn something new! As of right now I'm working on making my own lnk file parser, [lnk-parse](https://github.com/RaineDelay/LNK-parse).
